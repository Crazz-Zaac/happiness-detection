## Happiness Detection
Hello folks! Are you happy or are you not sure? Alright, let's build a model that will help you find out if you're happy or not. 

Well, let's start with some basic understanding of this tutorial and later dive deeper into the neural networks. We're very well known what popular Computer Vision is. It is one of the most popular field of machine learning. Happiness Detection is also one of such field where we apply Computer Vision techniques. This is a binary classification type of problem where we'll building a model that will detect whether the input image is either smiling or not.

Using Keras library to detect whether an image is Happy or Not Happy.
It is a binary classification type of problem where the model simply 
predicts '1' for happy and '0' for not happy.
